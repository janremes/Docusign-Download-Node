You acknowledge that failure to timely update the Software may prevent it from functioning, and that DocuSign shall have no liability for such malfunction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall immediately install any update or new version of the Software provided for the purpose of avoiding or resolving a third party claim of intellectual property infringement applicable to a previous version of the Software.

7.1 This License will be effective upon the Effective Date, and shall automatically terminate on the earlier of: (i) the expiration or termination of your right to receive the Subscription Service; (ii) 90 days from the date of commercial release of any subsequent version of the Software, or; (iii) DocuSign’s termination of this License, as permitted herein.

7.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, DocuSign may (at its sole discretion) suspend or terminate this License if you fail to comply with any term of this License. Upon termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Software and Documentation and if requested by DocuSign, certify in writing to DocuSign that all copies of the Software have been destroyed or deleted from any and all computer libraries or storage devices in your possession and/or control.

8. Feedback. If you provides any feedback to DocuSign concerning the functionality or performance of the Software (including identifying potential errors and improvements) (“Feedback”), you hereby assigns to DocuSign all right, title, and interest in and to the Feedback, and DocuSign is free to make unrestricted use the Feedback without any necessity of payment to you.  You represent and warrants that it is the sole owner of, or otherwise has the unfettered right or license to, make the foregoing assignment.

9. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. The Software is provided “AS IS” and without any warranties.  If an “AS IS” warranty is prohibited by law, then DocuSign warrants only to you that the electronic copy of the Software that is delivered to you by DocuSign will be free from material defects for 30 days following delivery.  DocuSign’s entire liability and your exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty will be, at DocuSign’s option, either repair or replacement of the electronic copy of the Software that does not meet this warranty.  This limited warranty will be void if failure of the Software has resulted from any accident, abuse, misuse, or misapplication by you.  YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DOCUSIGN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE.  DOCUSIGN MAKES NO WARRANTY AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, AND NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUSIGN’S EFFORTS WILL FULFILL ANY OF YOUR PARTICULAR PURPOSES OR NEEDS.

10. Risks Associated with Beta Software; No Technical Support. If the product you received with this License is pre-commercial release or beta Software (“Beta Version”), then this Section applies.  To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this License, this Section shall supersede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Beta Version, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.  WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR BETA VERSION SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, DOCUSIGN’S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF $50 IN TOTAL.  You acknowledge and agree that a Beta Version of the Software (as identified in the Documentation or the Help menu in the Software) is not commercially released Software, and the Software has not yet been tested like other commercially released software that you may use.  Therefore, it is likely that the Software will contain errors, including errors that may cause the Software or your systems to malfunction or cause a loss of data.  If you do not wish to accept the risk of errors in the Software, please do not install or use the Beta Version.  DocuSign is not obligated to correct errors, correct the effects of errors (e.g., fix your computer or recover lost data), or provide any technical support related to use of the Software.  The License to use a Beta Version of the Software will terminate immediately after a new version (Beta or other type) of the Software is released by DocuSign.  Upon receipt of a later unreleased Beta Version or release by DocuSign of a publicly released commercial version of the Software, you will return or destroy all earlier Beta Versions received from DocuSign and will abide by the terms of this License agreement for any such later versions. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, if you are located outside the United States of America, you agree that you will return or destroy all Beta Versions in your possession within 30 days of the completion of your testing of the Software when such date is earlier than the date for DocuSign’s first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial) Software.

11. Limitations of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL DOCUSIGN OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF A DOCUSIGN REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. DOCUSIGN’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. Nothing contained in this License limits DocuSign’s liability to you in the event of death or personal injury resulting from DocuSign’s gross negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). DocuSign is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this License, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.

12. Third Party Claims.  You will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend DocuSign (including all of its officers,
employees, directors, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, and agents) and DocuSign’s suppliers from and against
any damages (including attorneys’ fees and expenses), claims, and lawsuits that arise or result from your use of the
Software or your breach of this License.

13. Export Rules. You may not export or re-export the Software without: (a) the prior written consent of DocuSign; and (b) complying with all applicable export and import control laws and obtaining any necessary permits and licenses.

14. General Provisions.

14.1  Entire Agreement. This License is the final and complete expression of the agreement between the parties with respect to the Software and supersedes all previous oral and written communications regarding the Software.  If any part of this License is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of this License, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.  Except as expressly specified herein, this License may only be modified by a writing signed by an authorized officer of DocuSign.

14.2  Relationship.  At all times, the parties are independent actors, and are not the agents or representatives of the other.  This License is not intended to create a joint venture, partnership, or franchise relationship, or give rise to any third party beneficiary.

14.3 Mandatory Arbitration.  Except for claims arising under this License: (a) for breach of either party’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information; (b) arising out of the indemnity obligations specified in Section 13; and (c) for injunctive relief, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to this License or the performance, enforcement, breach, termination, validity or interpretation thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this License to arbitrate, that cannot be resolved through good faith discussions between the parties within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days), will be settled by binding arbitration conducted before one arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (”JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”).  Either party may submit the matter to arbitration.  Such disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitration will be held in the home jurisdiction of the party against whom arbitration is initiated.  Each party will bear its own expenses in the arbitration and will share equally the costs of the arbitration; provided, however, that the arbitrator may, in its discretion, award costs and fees to the prevailing party.  Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the award or over the applicable party or its assets.  This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

14.4  Governing Law.  This License will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules to the contrary.  Any legal action arising under this License must be initiated within two years after the cause of action arises.  Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this License.

14.5  Waiver.  The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this License does not waive any other breach.  The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this License will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this License.
